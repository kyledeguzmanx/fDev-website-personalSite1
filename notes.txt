---------------------------------------INSPIRATION--------------------------------------------

After nearly a week of letting this assignment ruminate in my mind, I still don't know where I want to take this. I know
that I don't want to repeat those big horizontal banners that I did in my first assignment-- just so there's varierty. 

I like the idea of a floating section with a transparent black backround.

I like the whole yellow transparent rectangle that's placed on top.I also really like the utilization of transparent png's.

I think the background-less navigation is really cool..

A lot of personal websites seem to use this layout. It's like a picture on one side, text on the other side. And they
both have a white background. I can appreciate the style

I love the background color and the big text. I can easily imagine replacing the picture with my face. I think it would like nice
but I also don't want to do a horizontal banner again. I want to try something new.

I really like big cluster of words. <https://d27yqot8savz5t.cloudfront.net/screengrabs/images/000/013/218/small.jpg>

I can't put my actual Twitter, but I think putting a twitter feed would be really cool -- especially because I've
never tried to do that


I like this a lot. The salmon-colored font which is all caps. I've been wanting to do a pretty grid like this, but
I don't know how I would incoproate that into my personal site. I also really like the image pointing out from the top. that's
really cool <http://www.verynicesites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Taostudio2.png>


This doesn't show it, but it inspired the idea. I think it would be really cool if the entire page's background was a single
image. I remember browsing through famous peoples' sites, and I saw this <https://www.ladygaga.com/> Anyway, this
new site gave me the idea to get a black and white vertical image and make it very transparent and faded that its barely
visible. It's a very minor detail but I think it builds onto the aesthetic
